The goal of the project is to familiarize you with the state-of-the-art research being conducted in the field.

## Milestones

- 1th Jan: The bidding of the papers end. The papers are assigned.
- TBD: 10-15 minute presentations.
- TBD: Turn in the final report.

## Choosing the project

- Choose a paper from the [list of papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xTV-97mMwUwHMeQMOWpRsI2wrSBei-xTYcW1FeIK3TY/edit?usp=sharing). 
- Papers that are not from the list are also allowed, as long as they are relevant to the course content. If you are interested in pursuing this option, please confirm with us.
- If you would like to pursue a project that is not relevant to any specific paper, please confirm with us.
- Comment yours and your partners’ name on the chosen paper in order to claim it.
- We prefer not to have multiple groups choosing the same paper.

## Tasks

### Minimum viable project (MVP)

- After reading the paper, try to identify the radius of works that are related to this paper.This will give you context about the contributions of this specific work. 
- For the papers that have ready implementations, try to reproduce the experiments and see if they remain consistent with the paper. 
- Write a ~10 page report. It should contain introduction to the problem, summary of related previous works, description, analysis & critical review of the paper, and demonstration of the results.
- Find the limitations of the chosen work, and propose ways to alleviate them.

### Bonus

Try to do something beyond the MVP. For example, apply the method to a new problem, code the proposed improvements (even if it really doesn’t improve, the attempt is fine) and etc. It is not limited to this. Anything creative will be rewarded!

### Presentations

Prepare 10-15 minutes talk explaining the paper, contributions, limitations, results. The presentatios will be held in the last week of the semester.

### Evaluation

- Presentation: 30%
- MVP: 60%
- Bonus: 10%

## Submission

Create a zip file titled `proj-id1_id2.zip` (replace `id1`/`id2` with your
IDs).

The zip file should include:
1. A single PDF document, `report.pdf`, containing your project report.
2. A folder `src/` containing all your own code.
3. A `README` file (plain text/markdown) explaining:
    1. The structure of the code in the `src/` folder: What is implemented in
       each package/module.
    2. Links to any external code you have used, including paper implementations.
    3. Steps to reproduce your results using this code: Where to get and place
       the data, how to run all the data processing steps, and etc.

Submission will be available [here](https://webcourse.cs.technion.ac.il/236860/Winter2019-2020).
