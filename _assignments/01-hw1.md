## FAQ

**Q**: What does it mean that the camera optics can be assumed to be an ideal anti-aliasing filter?

**A**: It means that the PSF, $h_k$, acts as an ideal anti-aliasing filter according to our sampling grid.


**Q**: Do we need to compute the integral in question 4?

**A**: No. You can find the upper bound without computing the integral.


**Q**: Do we need to compute the integral in questions 5 & 6?

**A**: Yes. We have seen similar integrals in the lecture.


**Q**: In question 7, what does it mean that the frames are pre-aligned?

**A**: We can assume that $o\left(\left(k+0.5\right)T\right)=0$ for each $k$, meaning that the camera is always located in the center of the scene in the middle of its movement during which the frame is taken.


**Q**: What is considered a valid answer for question 7?

**A**: Any reasonable algorithm that uses the mathematical foundation we have constructed during the previous questions. An algorithm without an explanation will not get any points.
