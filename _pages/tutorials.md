All tutorial materials are available from the course
[tutorial repository](https://github.com/vistalab-technion/cs236860-tutorials). We
recommend cloning it and pulling updates from it if you want to run the notebooks yourself.

A guide for running the notebooks on your local machine can be found [here](working-locally).

Additionally, the notebooks can be viewed in your browser by using
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vistalab-technion/cs236860-tutorials/tree/master/).
