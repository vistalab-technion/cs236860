Dear students,

Please find the lecture notes on discrete-domain signals and systems (Lecture 3 & 4) and random signals 
(the coming lecture). 

We recommend to have a short overlook on [the note on random signals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _lecture_notes/lecture_4.md %}) and the [supplementary note]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _supplements/probability_and_statistics.md %}) on probablity and statistics prior to the next class for enhanced understanding.  

Enjoy!

The course staff.
