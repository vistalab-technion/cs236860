Dear students,

Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSZSj9ok-a0-wbUtGYQG-uylclwN6tlzNhOV9Z8XdWQ/edit?usp=sharing) to the presentation schedule for the next Monday. We will follow the same order as mentioned in the above document. The whole seminar session is likely to exceed 2 hours. So, please email [Sanketh](mailto:sanketh@cs.technion.ac.il) in case you have a lesson right after and would like to reschedule your talk.

Please also check the previous post regarding the guidelines for the presentation.

Best of luck!

The course staff.
