Dear students,

We recommend to have a short overlook on [the note on random signals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _lecture_notes/lecture_4.md %}) and the [supplementary note]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _supplements/probability_and_statistics.md %}) on probablity and statistics prior to the next class for enhanced understanding.  

The course staff.
