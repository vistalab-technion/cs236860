Dear students,

1. Presentations slides should be emailed to [Sanketh](mailto:sanketh@cs.technion.ac.il) no later than **20/01/2019**. 

1. We will soon publish the order of presentations. Everyone will present from the same computer to reduce overhead between the presenters.

1. The presentation should address briefly the following points:
	- Full project title and description
	- The problem setting
	- Paper's contributions
	- Results
	- Suggested improvements, pros/cons etc.

1. Please keep your presentation short! Each group will be alloted **5 minutes** of time.

Best of luck!

The course staff
