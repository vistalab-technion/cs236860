The grades of the final project are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vR2SBw1v5OjWkvxtSR33dzfsb23WQb71vFjnsseqrKY/edit?usp=sharing).

The grades were given separately for the report and the bonus. The grade of the report reflects the quality of the answers given to the tasks enlisted as the MVP. The bonus grades were given based on scientific merit, relevancy, originality and the amount of effort that went into the work.
