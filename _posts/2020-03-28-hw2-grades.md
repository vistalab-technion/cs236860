The grades of the second assignment are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14W7waJn6eLryuAQQM8KwzZQSZ2KgnJqnBGbbGPV5vKk/edit?usp=sharing).

Appeals can be submitted by mailing Elia, the HW checker until 4.4 (see info section for details). In your appeals, please write the question you are refering to, the error number for which the points have been reduced, and clearly explain why the reduction isn't justified.
