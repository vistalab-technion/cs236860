## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to quickly refresh (presumably) known
notions in linear algebra. It contains a collection of facts related to
vectors, matrices, and geometric entities they represent that we will
use heavily in our course. Even though this quick reminder may seem
redundant or trivial to most of you (I hope), I still suggest at least
to skim through it, as it might present less common ways of
interpretation of very familiar definitions and properties. And even if
you discover nothing new in this document, it will at least be useful to
introduce notation.

## Notation

In our course, we will deal almost exclusively with the field of real
numbers, which we denote by $\RR$. An $n$-dimensional Euclidean space
will be denoted as $\RR^n$, and the space of $m \times n$ matrices as
$\RR^{m \times n}$. We will try to stick to a consistent typesetting
denoting a scalar $a$ with lowercase italic, a vector $\bb{a}$ in
lowercase bold, and a matrix $\bb{A}$ in uppercase bold. Elements of a
vector or a matrix will be denoted using subindices as $a_i$ and
$a_{ij}$, respectively. Unless stated otherwise, a vector is a column
vector, and we will write $\bb{a} = (a_1, \dots, a_n)^\Tr$ to save space
(here, $^\Tr$ is the transpose of the row vector $(a_1,\dots, a_n)$). In
the same way, $\bb{A} = (\bb{a}_1,\dots,\bb{a}_n)$ will refer to a
matrix constructed from $n$ column vectors $\bb{a}_i$. We will denote
the zero vector by $\bb{0}$, and the identity matrix by $\bb{I}$.

## Linear and affine spaces

Given a collection of vectors
$\{ \bb{v}_1,\dots,\bb{v}_m \in \bb{R}^n \}$, a new vector
$\bb{b} = a_1 \bb{v}_1 + \dots + a_m \bb{v}_m$, with
$a_1,\dots, a_m  \in \RR$ some scalars, is called a *linear combination*
of the $\bb{v}_i$’s. The collection of all linear combinations is called
a *linear subspace* of $\RR^n$, denoted by

$$\mathcal{L} = \spn{ \bb{v}_1,\dots,\bb{v}_m } = \{ a_1 \bb{v}_1 + \dots + a_m \bb{v}_m : a_1,\dots, a_m  \in \RR \}.$$

We will say that the $\bb{v}_i$’s *span* the linear subspace $\mathcal{L}$.

A vector $\bb{u}$ that cannot be described as a linear combination of
$\bb{v}_1,\dots,\bb{v}_m$ (i.e., $\bb{u} \notin \mathcal{L}$) is said to
be *linearly independent* of the latter vectors. The collection of
vectors $\{ \bb{v}_1,\dots,\bb{v}_m \}$ is linearly independent if no
$\bb{v}_i$ is a linear combination of the rest of the vectors. In such a
case, a vector in $\mathcal{L}$ can be unambiguously defined by the set
of $m$ scalars $a_1,\dots, a_m$; omitting any of these scalars will make
the description incomplete. Formally, we say that $m$ is the *dimension*
of the subspace, $\dim \,\mathcal{L} = m$.

Geometrically, an $m$-dimensional subspace is an $m$-dimensional plane
passing through the origin (a one-dimensional plane is a line, a
two-dimensional plane is the regular plane, and so on). The latter is
true, since setting all the $a_i$’s to zero in the definition of
$\mathcal{L}$ yields the zero vector. [Figure 1](#fig:lin-aff-subspace)
(left) visualizes this fact.

An *affine subspace* can be defined as a linear subspace shifted by a
vector $\bb{b} \in \RR^n$ away from the origin:

$$\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{L} + \bb{b} = \{ \bb{u} + \bb{b} : \bb{u} \in \mathcal{L} \}.$$

**Exercise**. Show that any affine subspace can be defined as

$$\mathcal{A} = \{ a_1 \bb{v}_1 + \dots + a_m \bb{v}_m : a_1 + \dots + a_m = 1 \}.$$

The latter linear combination with the scalars restricted to unit sum is
called an *affine combination*.

## Vector inner product and norms

Given two vectors $\bb{u}$ and $\bb{v}$ in $\RR^n$, we define their
*inner* (a.k.a. *scalar* or *dot*) *product* as

$$\langle \bb{u}, \bb{v} \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i = \bb{u}^\Tr \bb{v}.$$

Though the notion of an inner product is more general than this, we will
limit our attention exclusively to this particular case (and its matrix
equivalent defined in the sequel). This is sometimes called the standard
or the Euclidean inner product. The inner product defines or *induces* a
vector *norm*

$$\| \bb{u} \| = \sqrt{ \langle \bb{u}, \bb{u} \rangle }$$

(it is also convenient to write $\|\bb{u}\|^2 = \bb{u}^\Tr \bb{u}$),
which is called the Euclidean or the *induced* norm.

A more general notion of a norm can be introduced axiomatically. We will
say that a non-negative scalar function
$\| \cdot \| : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR_+$ is a norm if it satisfies the
following axioms for any scalar $a \in \RR$ and any vectors
$\bb{u},\bb{v} \in \RR^n$

1.  $\|a \bb{u} \| = | a | \| \bb{u} \|$ (this property is called
    *absolute homogeneity*);

2.  $\| \bb{u} + \bb{v} \| \le \| \bb{u} \| + \| \bb{v} \|$ (this
    property is called *subadditivity*, and since a norm induces a
    metric (distance function), the geometric name for it is *triangle
    inequality*);

3.  $\| \bb{u} \| = 0$ iff[^1] $\bb{u} = \bb{0}$.

In this course, we will almost exclusively restrict our attention to the
following family of norms called the $\ell_p$ norms:

For $1 \le p<\infty$, the $\ell_p$ norm of a vector $\bb{u} \in \RR^n$
is defined as
$$\| \bb{u} \|_p = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |u_i|^p \right)^{1/p}.$$

Note the sub-index $_p$. The Euclidean norm corresponds to $p=2$ (hence,
the alternative name, the $\ell_2$ norm) and, whenever confusion may
arise, we will denote it by $\| \cdot \|_2$.

Another important particular case of the $\ell_p$ family of norms is the
$\ell_1$ norm $$\| \bb{u} \|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n |u_i|.$$ As we will see,
when used to quantify errors for example in a regression or model
fitting task, the $\ell_1$ norm (representing mean absolute error) is
more robust (i.e., less sensitive to noisy data) than the Euclidean norm
(representing mean squared error). The selection of $p=1$ is the
smallest among the $\ell_p$ norms for which the norm is *convex*. In
this course, we will dedicate significant attention to this important
notion, as convexity will have profound impact on solvability of
optimization problems.

Yet another important particular case is the $\ell_\infty$ norm
$$\| \bb{u} \|_\infty = \max_{i=1,\dots,n} |u_i|.$$ The latter can be
obtained as the limit of $\ell_p$.

**Exercise**. Show that $$\displaystyle{\lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} \| \bb{u} \|_p =
\max_{i=1,\dots,n} |u_i|}$$.

Geometrically, a norm measures the *length* of a vector; a vector of
length $\|\bb{u}\|=1$ is said to be a *unit vector* (with respect to[^2]
that norm). The collection $\{ \bb{u} : \| \bb{u} \| = 1 \}$ of all unit
vectors is called the *unit circle* ([see figure](#fig:norm-unit-circles)).
Note that the unit circle is indeed a “circle” only for the Euclidean
norm. Similarly, the collection
$B_r = \{ \bb{u} : \| \bb{u} \| \le r \}$ of all vectors with length no
bigger than $r$ is called the *ball of radius $r$* (w.r.t. a given
norm). Again, norm balls are round only for the Euclidean norm. From
[figure 2](#fig:norm-unit-circles) we can deduce that for $p < q$, the
$\ell_p$ unit circle is fully contained in the $\ell_q$ unit circle.
This means that the $\ell_p$ norm is *bigger* than the $\ell_q$ norm in
the sense that $\| \bb{u} \|_q \le \| \bb{b}\|_p$.

**Exercise**. Show that $\| \bb{u} \|_q \le \| \bb{b}\|_p$ for every $p < q$.

Continuing the geometric interpretation, it is worthwhile mentioning
several relations between the inner product and the $\ell_2$ norm it
induces. The inner product of two ($\ell_2$-) unit vectors measures the
cosine of the angle between them or, more generally,
$$\langle \bb{u}, \bb{v} \rangle = \| \bb{u} \|_2 \| \bb{v} \|_2 \cos \theta,$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between $\bb{u}$ and $\bb{v}$. Two vectors
satisfying $\langle \bb{u}, \bb{v} \rangle = 0$ are said to be
*orthogonal* (if the vectors are unit, they are also said to be
*orthonormal*) – the algebraic way of saying “perpendicular”.

The following result is doubtlessly the most important inequality in
linear algebra (and, perhaps, in mathematics in general):

**Theorem: Cauchy-Schwartz inequality**.
Let $\| \cdot \|$ be the norm induced by an inner product
$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ on $\RR^n$, Then, for any
$\bb{u}, \bb{v} \in \RR^n$,

$$| \langle \bb{u}, \bb{v} \rangle | \le \| \bb{u} \| \| \bb{v} \|$$

with equality holding iff $\bb{u}$ and $\bb{v}$ are linearly dependent.

## Matrices

A *linear map* from the $n$-dimensional linear space $\RR^n$ to the
$m$-dimensional linear space $\RR^m$ is a function mapping
$\bb{u} \in \RR^n$ $\bb{v} \in \RR^m$ according to

$$v_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} u_j  \ \ \ i=1,\dots,m.$$

The latter can be
expressed compactly using the matrix-vector product notation
$\bb{v} = \bb{A} \bb{u}$, where $\bb{A}$ is the matrix with the elements
$a_{ij}$. In other words, a matrix $\bb{A} \in \RR^{m \times n}$ is a
compact way of expressing a linear map between $\RR^m$ and $\RR^n$. An
matrix is said to be *square* of $m=n$; such a matrix defines an
operator mapping $\RR^n$ to itself. A *symmetric* matrix is a square
matrix $\bb{A}$ such that $\bb{A}^\Tr = \bb{A}$.

Recollecting our notion of linear combinations and linear subspaces,
observe that the vector $\bb{v} = \bb{A}\bb{u}$ is the linear
combination of the columns $\bb{a}_1,\dots,\bb{a}_n$ of $\bb{A}$ with
the weights $u_1,\dots,u_n$. The linear subspace
$\bb{A} \RR^m = \{ \bb{A} \bb{u} : \bb{u} \in \RR^m \ \}$ is called the
*columns space* of $\bb{A}$. The space is $n$-dimensional if the columns
are linearly independent; otherwise, if $k$ columns are linearly
dependent, the space is $n-k$ dimensional. The latter dimension is
called the *column rank* of the matrix. By transposing the matrix, the
*row rank* can be defined in the same way. The following result is
fundamental in linear algebra:

**Theorem**. The column rank and the row rank of a matrix are always equal.

**Exercise**. Prove the above theorem.

Since the row and the column ranks of a matrix are equal, we will simply
refer to both as *the rank*, denoting $\rank\, \bb{A}$. A square
$n \times n$ matrix is *full rank* if its rank is $n$, and is *rank
deficient* otherwise. Full rank is a necessary condition for a square
matrix to possess an *inverse* (Reminder: the inverse of a matrix
$\bb{A}$ is such a matrix $\bb{B}$ that
$\bb{A}\bb{B} = \bb{B}\bb{A} = \bb{I}$; when the inverse exists, the
matrix is called *invertible* and its inverse is denoted by
$\bb{A}^{-1}$).

In this course, we will often encounter the *trace* of a square matrix,
which is defined as the sum of its diagonal entries,
$$\trace\, \bb{A} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i.$$ The following property of the
trace will be particularly useful:

Let $\bb{A} \in \RR^{m \times n}$ and $\bb{B} \in \RR^{n \times m}$.
Then $\trace(\bb{A}\bb{B}) = \trace(\bb{B}\bb{A})$.

This is in sharp contrast to the result of the product itself, which is
generally not commutative.

In particular, the squared norm $\| \bb{u} \|^2 = \bb{u}^\Tr \bb{u}$ can
be written as $\trace(\bb{u}^\Tr \bb{u}) = \trace(\bb{u}\bb{u}^\Tr)$. We
will see many cases where such an apparently weird writing is very
useful. The above property can be generalized to the product of $k$
matrices $\bb{A}_1 \dots \bb{A}_k$ by saying that
*$\trace(\bb{A}_1 \dots \bb{A}_k)$ is invariant under a cyclic
permutation of the factors as long as their product is defined*. For
example,
$\trace(\bb{A}\bb{B}^\Tr\bb{C}) = \trace(\bb{C}\bb{A}\bb{B}^\Tr) = \trace(\bb{B}^\Tr\bb{C}\bb{A})$
(again, as long as the matrix dimensions are such that the products are
defined).

## Matrix inner product and norms

The notion of an inner product can be extended to matrices by thinking
of an $m \times n$ matrix as of a long vector $m \times n$ vector
containing the matrix elements for example, in the column-stack order.
We will denote such a vector as
$\vec(\bb{A}) = (a_{11},\dots,a_{m1},a_{12},\dots,a_{m2},\dots,a_{1n},\dots,a_{mn})^\Tr$.
With such an interpretation, we can define the inner product of two
matrices as
$$\langle \bb{A}, \bb{B} \rangle = \langle \vec(\bb{A}), \vec(\bb{B}) \rangle = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} b_{ij}.$$

**Exercise**. Show that $\langle \bb{A}, \bb{B} \rangle = \trace( \bb{A}^\Tr \bb{B} )$.

The inner product induces the standard Euclidean norm on the space of
column-stack representation of matrices,

$$\| \bb{A} \| = \sqrt{ \langle \bb{A}, \bb{A} \rangle }
= \sqrt{ \langle \vec(\bb{A}), \vec(\bb{B}) \rangle } = \sqrt{ \sum_{i,j} a_{ij}^2 },$$

known as the *Frobenius norm*. Using the result of the exercise above,
we can write

$$\| \bb{A} \|_\mathrm{F}^2 = \trace( \bb{A}^\Tr \bb{A} ).$$

Note the qualifier $_\mathrm{F}$ used to distinguish this norm from other matrix
norm that we will define in the sequel.

There exist another “standard” way of defining matrix norms by thinking
of an $m \times n$ matrix $\bb{A}$ as a linear operator mapping between
two normed spaces, say,
$\bb{A} : (\RR^m,\ell_p) \rightarrow (\RR^n,\ell_q)$. Then, we can
define the *operator norm* measuring the maximum change of length (in
the $\ell_q$ sense) of a unit (in the $\ell_p$ sense) vector in the
operator domain:

$$\| \bb{A} \|_{p,q} = \max_{\| \bb{u} \|_p = 1} \| \bb{A} \bb{u} \|_q.$$

**Exercise**. Use the axioms of a norm to show that $\| \bb{A} \|_{p,q}$ is a norm.

## Eigendecomposition

*Eigendecomposition* (a.k.a. *eigenvalue decomposition* or in some
contexts *spectral decomposition*, from the German *eigen* for “self”)
is doubtlessly the most important and useful forms of matrix
factorization. The following discussion will be valid only for square
matrices.

Recall that an $n \times n$ matrix $\bb{A}$ represents a linear map on
$\RR^n$. In general, the effect of $\bb{A}$ on a vector $\bb{u}$ is a
new vector $\bb{v} = \bb{A}\bb{u}$, rotated and elongated or shrunk
(and, potentially, reflected). However, there exist vectors which are
only elongated or shrunk by $\bb{A}$. Such vectors are called
*eigenvectors*. Formally, an eigenvector of $\bb{A}$ is a non-zero
vector $\bb{u}$ satisfying $\bb{A}\bb{u} = \lambda \bb{u}$, with the
scalar $\lambda$ (called *eigenvalue*) measuring the amount of
elongation or shrinkage of $\bb{u}$ (if $\lambda < 0$, the vector is
reflected). Note that the scale of an eigenvector has no meaning as it
appears on both sides of the equation; for this reason, eigenvectors are
always normalized (in the $\ell_2$ sense). For reasons not so relevant
to our course, the collection of the eigenvalues is called the
*spectrum* of a matrix.

For an $n\times n$ matrix $\bb{A}$ with $n$ linearly independent
eigenvectors we can write the following system

$$
\left\{
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        \bb{A} \bb{u}_1  & = & \lambda_1 \bb{u}_1  \\
        \vdots & &  \vdots \\
        \bb{A} \bb{u}_n  & = & \lambda_n \bb{u}_n \\
    \end{array}
\right.
$$

Stacking the eigenvectors into the columns of
the $n \times n$ matrix $\bb{U} = (\bb{u}_1,\dots,\bb{u}_n)$, and
defining the diagonal matrix

$$\bb{\Lambda} = \diag\{\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n \} = \left(
                   \begin{array}{ccc}
                     \lambda_1 &  &  \\
                               & \ddots &  \\
                               &  & \lambda_n \\
                   \end{array}
                   \right),
$$

we can rewrite the system more compactly as
$\bb{A}\bb{U} = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}$. Independent eigenvectors means that
$\bb{U}$ is invertible, which leads to
$\bb{A} = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^{-1}$. Geometrically,
eigendecomposition of a matrix can be interpreted as a change of
coordinates into a basis, in which the action of a matrix can be
described as elongation or shrinkage only (represented by the diagonal
matrix $\bb{\Lambda}$).

If the matrix $\bb{A}$ is symmetric, it can be shown that its
eigenvectors are orthonormal, i.e.,
$\langle \bb{u}_i, \bb{u}_j \rangle = \bb{u}_i^\Tr \bb{u}_j = 0$ for
every $i \ne j$ and, since the eigenvectors have unit length,
$\bb{u}_i^\Tr \bb{u} = 1$. This can be compactly written as
$\bb{U}^\Tr \bb{U} = \bb{I}$ or, in other words,
$\bb{U}^{-1} = \bb{U}^\Tr$. Matrices satisfying this property are called
*orthonormal* or *unitary*, and we will say that symmetric matrices
admit *unitary eigendecomposition*
$\bb{A} = \bb{U} \bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^\Tr$.

**Exercise**. Show that a symmetric matrix admits unitary eigendecomposition
$\bb{A} = \bb{U} \bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^\Tr$.

Finally, we note two very simple but useful facts about
eigendecomposition:

- $\displaystyle{\trace\,\bb{A} = \trace(\bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^{-1}) =  \trace(\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^{-1}\bb{U}) = \trace\,\bb{\Lambda} = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i}$.

- $\displaystyle{\det\bb{A} = \det\bb{U}\det\bb{\Lambda}\det\bb{U}^{-1} =  \det \bb{U} \det \bb{\Lambda} \frac{1}{\det \bb{U}} = \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i}$.

In other words, the trace and the determinant of a matrix are given by
the sum and the product of its eigenvalues, respectively.

## Matrix functions

Eigendecomposition is a very convenient way of performing various matrix
operations. For example, if we are given the eigendecomposition of
$\bb{A} = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^{-1}$, its inverse can be expressed
as
$\bb{A}^{-1} = (\bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^{-1})^{-1} = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}^{-1}\bb{U}^{-1}$;
however, since $\bb{\Lambda}$ is diagonal,
$\bb{\Lambda}^{-1} =\diag\{1/\lambda_1,\dots,1/\lambda_n\}$. (This does
not suggest, of course, that this is the computationally preferred way
to invert matrices, as the eigendecomposition itself is a costly
operation).

A similar idea can be applied to the square of a matrix:
$\bb{A}^2 = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^{-1} \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^{-1} = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}^2\bb{U}^{-1}$
and, again, we note that
$\bb{\Lambda}^2 =\diag\{\lambda_1^2,\dots,\lambda_n^2\}$. By using
induction, we can generalize this result to any integer power $p \ge 0$:
$\bb{A}^p = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}^p\bb{U}^{-1}$. (Here, if, say, $p=1000$,
the computational advantage of using eigendecomposition might be well
justified).

Going one step further, let

$$\varphi(t) = \sum_{i \ge 0} c_i t^i$$

be a polynomial (either of a finite degree or an infinite series). We can apply
this function to a square matrix $\bb{A}$ as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\varphi(\bb{A}) &=& \sum_{i \ge 0} c_i \bb{A}^i = \sum_{i \ge 0} c_i \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}^p\bb{U}^{-1} \nonumber\\
&=& \bb{U} \left( \sum_{i \ge 0} c_i  \bb{\Lambda}^p \right) \bb{U}^{-1} =
\bb{U} \left( \sum_{i \ge 0}  \diag\{c_i \lambda_1^i,\dots,c_i \lambda_n^i\} \right) \bb{U}^{-1} \nonumber\\
&=& \bb{U} \left(
                   \begin{array}{ccc}
                    \sum_{i \ge 0} c_i \lambda_1^i &  &  \\
                               & \ddots &  \\
                               &  & \sum_{i \ge 0} c_i \lambda_n^i \\
                   \end{array}
                 \right)  \bb{U}^{-1} \nonumber\\
                 &=& \bb{U} \diag\{\varphi(\lambda_1),\dots,\varphi(\lambda_n)\} \bb{U}^{-1}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Denoting by
$\varphi(\bb{\Lambda}) = \diag\{\varphi(\lambda_1),\dots,\varphi(\lambda_n)\}$
the diagonal matrix formed by the element-wise application of the scalar
function $\varphi$ to the eigenvalues of $\bb{A}$, we can write
compactly

$$\varphi(\bb{A}) = \bb{U} \varphi(\bb{\Lambda}) \bb{U}^{-1}.$$

Finally, since many functions can be described polynomial series, we can
generalize the latter definition to a (more or less) arbitrary scalar function
$\varphi$.

The above procedure is a standard way of constructing a *matrix function* (this
term is admittedly confusing, as we will see it assuming another meaning); for
example, matrix exponential and logarithm are constructed exactly like this.
Note that the construction is sharply different from applying the function
$\varphi$ *element-wise*!

## Positive definite matrices

Symmetric square matrices define an important family of functions called
quadratic forms that we will encounter very often in this course.
Formally, a *quadratic form* is a scalar function on $\RR^n$ given by
$$\bb{x}^\Tr \bb{A} \bb{x} = \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij} x_i x_j,$$ where
$\bb{A}$ is a symmetric $n \times n$ matrix, and $\bb{x} \in \RR^n$.

A symmetric square matrix $\bb{A}$ is called *positive definite*
(denoted as $\bb{A} \succ 0$) iff for every $\bb{x} \ne \bb{0}$,
$\bb{x}^\Tr \bb{A} \bb{x} > 0$. The matrix is called *positive
semi-definite* (denoted as $\bb{A} \succeq 0$) if the inequality is
weak.

Positive (semi-) definite matrices can be equivalently defined through
their eigendecomposition:

Let $\bb{A}$ be a symmetric matrix admitting the eigendecomposition
$\bb{A} = \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^\Tr$. Then $\bb{A} \succ 0$ iff
$\lambda_i > 0$ for $i=1,\dots,n$. Similarly, $\bb{A} \succeq 0$ iff
$\lambda_i \ge 0$.

In other words, the matrix is positive (semi-) definite if it has
positive (non-negative) spectrum. To get a hint why this is true,
consider an arbitrary vector $\bb{x} \ne \bb{0}$, and write

$$
\bb{x}^\Tr \bb{A} \bb{x} =
\bb{x}^\Tr \bb{U}\bb{\Lambda}\bb{U}^\Tr \bb{x} =
(\bb{U}^\Tr \bb{x})^\Tr \bb{\Lambda}(\bb{U}^\Tr \bb{x})
$$

Denoting $\bb{y} = \bb{U}^\Tr \bb{x}$, we have

$$\bb{x}^\Tr \bb{A} \bb{x}  = \bb{y}^\Tr \bb{\Lambda} \bb{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i y_i^2.$$

Since $\bb{U}^\Tr$ is full rank, the vector $\bb{y}$ is also an
arbitrary non-zero vector in $\RR^n$ and the only way to make the latter
sum always positive is by ensuring that all $\lambda_i$ are positive.
The very same reasoning is also true in the opposite direction.

Geometrically, a quadratic form describes a second-order (hence the name
quadratic) surface in $\RR^n$, and the eigenvalues of the matrix
$\bb{A}$ can be interpreted as the surface curvature. Very informally,
if a certain eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ is positive, a small step in the
direction of the corresponding eigenvector $\bb{u}_i$ rotates the normal
to the surface in the same direction. The surface is said to have
*positive curvature* in that direction. Similarly, a negative eigenvalue
corresponds to the normal rotating in the opposite direction of the step
(negative curvature). Finally, if $\lambda_i = 0$, a step in the
direction of $\bb{u}_i$ leave the normal unchanged (the surface is said
to be *flat* in that direction). A quadratic form created by a positive
definite matrix represents a positively curved surface in all
directions. Such a surface is cup-shaped (if you can imagine an
$n$-dimensional cup) or, formally, is *convex*; in the sequel, we will
see the important consequences this property has on optimization
problems.

[^1]: We will henceforth abbreviate “if and only if” as “iff”. Two
    statements related by “iff” are equivalent; for example, if one of
    the statements is a definition of some object, and the other is its
    property, the latter property can be used as an alternative
    definition. We will see many such examples.

[^2]: We will often abbreviate “with respect to” as “w.r.t.”
